In the process of writing a bunch of gems, I found myself reaching for the same
gems again and again, and realized it would be easier to keep one meta-gem that
handles everything and use that in my various projects. Since the gem should
only be used as a development dependency, should something within the gem not
get used, there's no real penalty (besides a little disk space)
